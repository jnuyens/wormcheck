# wormcheck
Checks for Linux worms

PHP worms aren't checked for _by the tools I know_ so I wrote this tool to check for those PHP worms which I found 'in the wild'.

#Usage
` git clone https://github.com/jnuyens/wormcheck.git `
` cd wormcheck `
Verify if locations of websites in /var/www is ok or not
Logging is also configureable and will go to /tmp/wormcheck-{date}.txt
` sudo ./wormcheck.sh `


Enjoy!
